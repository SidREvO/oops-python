        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects.\" These objects encapsulate both data (attributes) and the functions that operate on that data (methods). OOP aims to model real-world entities and their interactions within a program.\n",
        "   Key Concepts:\n",
        "   Classes:\n",
        "    Blueprints for creating objects. They define the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) that objects of that class will possess.\n",
        "    Objects:\n",
        "    Instances of a class. They are concrete entities created based on the class's blueprint.\n",
        "    Encapsulation:\n",
        "    Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (object). It hides the internal implementation details and exposes only necessary interfaces.\n",
        "    Inheritance:\n",
        "    Allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "    Polymorphism:\n",
        "    The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way. It enables flexibility and adaptability.\n",
        "    Abstraction:\n",
        "    Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential information to the user. It simplifies program design and usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Think of a class as a template or a recipe for creating objects.\n",
        "      Key Concepts:\n",
        "      Blueprint: A class acts as a blueprint, defining the structure and behavior of objects.\n",
        "      Objects: Objects are instances of a class, created based on the class's blueprint.\n",
        "      Attributes: Attributes are variables that store data associated with an object.\n",
        "      Methods: Methods are functions that define the actions an object can perform.\n",
        "      class Keyword: The class keyword is used to define a class.\n",
        "      __init__ Method: The __init__ method is a special method used to initialize an object's attributes when it is created.\n",
        "      Self: The self keyword refers to the instance of the class being used. It's used to access attributes and methods within the class.\n",
        "      eg:\n",
        "          class Car:\n",
        "            def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",

        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   -In Python, an object is an instance of a            class, which acts as a blueprint for creating objects. Each object contains data (variables) and methods to operate on that data. Python is object-oriented, meaning it focuses on objects and their interactions. For a better understanding of the concept of objects in Python. Let's consider an example, many of you have played CLASH OF CLANS, So let's assume base layout as the class which contains all the buildings, defenses, resources, etc. Based on these descriptions we make a village, here the village is the object in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Creating an object\n",
        "      When creating an object from a class, we use a special method called the constructor, defined as __init__(), to initialize the object's attributes. Example:\n",
        "      class Car:\n",
        "          def __init__(self, model, price):\n",
        "              self.model = model\n",

        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__). They enable user-defined classes to behave like built-in types and integrate with Python's standard operations.\n",
        "    Purpose:\n",
        "    Dunder methods allow you to customize how your objects interact with Python's syntax, operators, and built-in functions. They provide a way to overload operators and define the behavior of your objects in various contexts.\n",
        "    Naming Convention:\n",
        "    The double underscores (__) at the beginning and end of the method name denote their special status.\n",
        "    Implicit Invocation:\n",
        "    These methods are not called directly. Instead, they are automatically invoked by the Python interpreter when certain operations are performed on your objects. For example, __add__ is called when you use the + operator.\n",
        "    Common Examples:\n",
        "    __init__(self, ...): Constructor; initializes object attributes.\n",
        "    __str__(self): Returns a string representation of the object for end-users.\n",
        "    __repr__(self): Returns a string representation of the object for developers.\n",
        "    __len__(self): Returns the length of the object.\n",
        "    __getitem__(self, key): Enables indexing (e.g., obj[key]).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in oops.\n",
        "   - Inheritance in Python is a mechanism where a new class (child class or subclass) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent class or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "    Key Concepts:\n",
        "    Parent Class (Base Class or Superclass): The class whose properties are inherited.\n",
        "    Child Class (Derived Class or Subclass): The class that inherits properties from the parent class.\n",
        "    Code Reusability: Child classes can reuse code from parent classes without rewriting it.\n",
        "    Extensibility: Child classes can add new attributes and methods or modify inherited ones.\n",
        "    Types of Inheritance:\n",
        "    Single Inheritance: A child class inherits from a single parent class.\n",
        "    Multiple Inheritance: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "    Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.\n",
        "    Multilevel Inheritance: A child class inherits from another child class.\n",
        "    Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n",
        "    eg:\n",
        "          class Animal:\n",
        "              def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "                  self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "              def speak(self):\n",
        "                  print(\"Generic animal sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "          class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "              def speak(self):\n",
        "                  print(\"Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "          class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "              def speak(self):\n",
        "                  print(\"Meow!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "          dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
        "          cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
        "\n",
        "          dog.speak()  # Output: Woof!\n",
        "          cat.speak()  # Output: Meow!\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in oops?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism, derived from the Greek words \"poly\" (many) and \"morph\" (form), refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In Python, this concept allows the same function or method to behave differently depending on the object it is called upon.\n",
        "    There are two main types of polymorphism:\n",
        "    Compile-time (or static) Polymorphism:\n",
        "    This type is determined at compile time. In Python, this is primarily achieved through method overloading, where the same method name can have different implementations based on the number or type of arguments passed.\n",
        "    Run-time (or dynamic) Polymorphism:\n",
        "    This type is resolved during runtime. It is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. Duck typing, where an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods, is also a form of runtime polymorphism in Python.\n",
        "    Polymorphism is a core principle of object-oriented programming, enabling flexibility and code reusability. It allows developers to write generic code that can operate on objects of different types without needing to know their specific classes. This makes the code more adaptable and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class. This is done to hide the internal implementation details and provide a clear interface for interaction.\n",
        "    Here's how it's typically implemented:\n",
        "    1. Access Modifiers:\n",
        "    Public Members:\n",
        "    By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are public. They can be accessed from anywhere using the dot operator.\n",
        "    Protected Members:\n",
        "    These are indicated by a single underscore prefix (e.g., _attribute). They are intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses, but can still be accessed from outside, though it's not recommended.\n",
        "    Private Members:\n",
        "    These are denoted by a double underscore prefix (e.g., __attribute). Python uses name mangling to make them harder to access directly from outside the class, but they are not truly private.\n",
        "    2. Getters and Setters:\n",
        "    Getters are methods used to access the values of private or protected attributes.\n",
        "    Setters are methods used to modify the values of private or protected attributes.\n",
        "    This allows you to control how attributes are accessed and modified, adding logic or validation if needed.\n",
        "    3. Property Decorator:\n",
        "    The @property decorator allows you to define methods that behave like attributes. This can be combined with getter and setter methods to provide a controlled way to access and modify attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What are constructor in python?\n",
        "   - In Python, a constructor is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created from a class. Its main role is to initialize the object by setting up its attributes or state.\n",
        "\n",
        "    The method __new__ is the constructor that creates a new instance of the class while __init__ is the initializer that sets up the instance's attributes after creation. These methods work together to manage object creation and initialization.\n",
        "\n",
        "    __new__ Method\n",
        "    This method is responsible for creating a new instance of a class. It allocates memory and returns the new object. It is called before __init__.\n",
        "    Types of Constructors\n",
        "    Constructors can be of two types.\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Default Constructor\n",
        "    A default constructor does not take any parameters other than self. It initializes the object with default attribute values.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2.Parameterized Constructor\n",
        "    A parameterized constructor accepts arguments to initialize the object's attributes with specific values.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and Static method in python?\n",
        "    - Class Methods:\n",
        "      Class methods are bound to the class and not the instance of the class.\n",
        "      They receive the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls.\n",
        "      They can access and modify class-level attributes but cannot access instance-specific attributes.\n",
        "      Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "      They are often used as factory methods for creating instances of the class or modifying class-level data.\n",
        "      Static Methods:\n",
        "      Static methods are also bound to the class, not the instance of the class.\n",
        "      They do not receive any special first argument (neither self nor cls).\n",
        "      They cannot access or modify class-level or instance-specific attributes.\n",
        "      Static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "      They are essentially utility functions that are logically grouped within a class, but don't depend on its state.\n",
        "\n",
        "      eg:\n",
        "          class MyClass:\n",
        "              count = 0 # Class variable\n",
        "\n",
        "              def __init__(self, value): # Instance method\n",
        "                  self.value = value\n",
        "\n",
        "              @classmethod\n",
        "              def increment_count(cls):\n",
        "                  cls.count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "              @staticmethod\n",
        "              def add(x, y):\n",
        "                  return x + y\n",
        "\n",
        "          # Using class method\n",
        "          MyClass.increment_count()\n",
        "          print(MyClass.count)  # Output: 1\n",
        "\n",
        "          # Using static method\n",
        "          result = MyClass.add(5, 3)\n",
        "          print(result) # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "          # Using instance method\n",
        "          obj = MyClass(10)\n",
        "          print(obj.value) # Output: 10\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in python?\n",
        "    - Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name within a class, but with different parameters. While Python doesn't support traditional method overloading like languages such as Java or C++, it achieves a similar effect through flexible argument handling.\n",
        "    Here are the primary ways Python simulates method overloading:\n",
        "    Default Arguments: You can define a method with default values for some parameters. This allows you to call the method with varying numbers of arguments. eg:\n",
        "          def my_method(a, b=0):\n",
        "              print(a, b)\n",
        "\n",
        "          my_method(5)  # Output: 5 0\n",
        "          my_method(5, 10)  # Output: 5 10\n",
        "\n",
        "      Variable-Length Arguments (\\*args and \\*\\*kwargs):\n",
        "      *args allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a method, which are then received as a tuple.\n",
        "      **kwargs allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a method, which are then received as a dictionary. eg:\n",
        "              def my_method(*args):\n",
        "                  for arg in args:\n",
        "                      print(arg)\n",
        "\n",
        "              my_method(1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "              def my_method(**kwargs):\n",
        "                for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
        "                      print(key, value)\n",
        "\n",
        "              my_method(name=\"John\", age=30)\n",
        "\n",
        "12. what is property decorator in python?\n",
        "    - The @property decorator in Python is a built-in feature that allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. This provides a way to control access and modification of class attributes, enabling features like data validation, computation, and lazy evaluation. It essentially turns a method into a \"managed attribute\".\n",
        "      Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:\n",
        "      Purpose:\n",
        "      Encapsulation: Hides the internal implementation details of an attribute, allowing you to modify how it's accessed without affecting the external interface of the class.\n",
        "      Access Control: Provides a way to control how an attribute is read, written, or deleted.\n",
        "      Data Validation: Enables you to validate data before it's assigned to an attribute.\n",
        "      Computed Attributes: Allows you to define attributes that are calculated dynamically based on other attributes.\n",
        "      Read-only Attributes: You can create read-only attributes by defining only the getter method.\n",
        "      How it Works:\n",
        "      Getter Method:\n",
        "      The method decorated with @property acts as a getter for the attribute, returning its value.\n",
        "      Setter Method:\n",
        "      The method decorated with @attribute_name.setter acts as a setter for the attribute, allowing you to modify its value, often with validation logic.\n",
        "      Deleter Method:\n",
        "      The method decorated with @attribute_name.deleter acts as a deleter, allowing you to define custom behavior when deleting the attribute.\n",

        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "     - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. This means a single class can combine the functionalities of several distinct classes, promoting code reuse and flexibility.\n",
        "      When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, the order in which the parent classes are listed in the class definition becomes significant. Python uses a method resolution order (MRO) to determine the order in which methods are inherited and called. The MRO follows a depth-first, left-to-right approach, meaning it first searches the child class itself, then the first parent class listed, then the parent of that class, and so on.\n",
        "      Multiple inheritance can lead to complex inheritance hierarchies and potential issues, such as the \"diamond problem,\" where a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor. This can result in ambiguity about which version of a method to call. To address this, Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO, which ensures a consistent and predictable order of method resolution.\n",
        "      While multiple inheritance can be powerful, it's crucial to use it judiciously and consider alternatives like mixins or composition to avoid creating overly complex and difficult-to-manage class hierarchies.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, the __str__ and __repr__ methods are special methods used to define how an object should be represented as a string.\n",
        "    __str__ Method:\n",
        "    The __str__ method provides a human-readable or informal string representation of an object.\n",
        "    It is primarily intended for end-users and is called by the built-in str() function and when the print() function is used on an object.\n",
        "    The output of __str__ should be user-friendly and easy to understand.\n",
        "    If a class does not define a __str__ method, Python will fall back to using the __repr__ method.\n",
        "    __repr__ Method:\n",
        "    The __repr__ method provides a more detailed, formal, and unambiguous string representation of an object.\n",
        "    It is primarily intended for developers and is called by the built-in repr() function and in interactive environments.\n",
        "    The ideal output of __repr__ should be a string that, when passed to the eval() function, can recreate the original object. However, this is not always possible or necessary.\n",
        "    The __repr__ method is used for debugging, logging, and object inspection, providing all information about the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "    - The super() function in Python is a built-in function that allows a subclass to access methods and properties of its parent class. It is primarily used in the context of inheritance, a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
        "    Key aspects of the super() function:\n",
        "    Accessing parent class methods:\n",
        "    super() provides a way to call methods defined in the parent class from within the subclass. This is particularly useful when you want to extend or modify the behavior of a parent class method in the subclass while still retaining the original functionality.\n",
        "    Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
        "    super() follows the MRO, which is the order in which Python searches for methods in a class hierarchy. This ensures that methods are called in a consistent and predictable manner, especially in cases of multiple inheritance.\n",
        "    Avoiding hardcoding:\n",
        "    Instead of directly referencing the parent class name, super() allows you to call parent class methods dynamically. This makes your code more flexible and maintainable, as you don't need to change the code if the inheritance hierarchy changes.\n",
        "    Initialization:\n",
        "    A common use case for super() is in the __init__() method (constructor) of a subclass. It allows you to initialize the attributes of the parent class before adding or modifying attributes specific to the subclass.\n",
        "    Multiple inheritance:\n",
        "    super() can be effectively used in multiple inheritance scenarios to access methods from different parent classes in the order defined by the MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - The __del__ method in Python is a special method, often referred to as a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. This usually happens when all references to an object are removed, or when the program terminates.\n",
        "      The primary purpose of __del__ is to perform cleanup actions, such as releasing external resources (e.g., closing files, network connections, or database connections) that the object might have acquired during its lifetime.\n",
        "      Here are some key points about __del__:\n",
        "      Automatic Invocation:\n",
        "      Python's garbage collector automatically calls __del__ when an object is no longer needed.\n",
        "      Resource Management:\n",
        "      It's commonly used to release resources acquired by the object.\n",
        "      Unpredictable Timing:\n",
        "      The exact timing of __del__ calls is not guaranteed, as it depends on the garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods within a class that are not bound to a specific instance of the class. However, they differ in how they interact with the class itself.\n",
        "    @staticmethod:\n",
        "    A static method is a method that belongs to the class but does not have access to the instance (self) or the class itself (cls).\n",
        "    It is essentially a function that is grouped within a class for logical organization or to provide utility functions related to the class.\n",
        "    Static methods are called directly on the class itself, without needing to create an instance of the class.\n",
        "    They cannot access or modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "    @classmethod:\n",
        "    A class method is a method that is bound to the class and receives the class itself (cls) as its first argument.\n",
        "    It can access and modify class-level attributes, making it suitable for operations that involve class-specific data or for creating alternative constructors (factory methods).\n",
        "    Class methods are also called directly on the class itself.\n",
        "    They can be overridden by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways. In Python, this is primarily achieved through inheritance and method overriding.\n",
        "    Inheritance:\n",
        "    A child class inherits methods and attributes from a parent class. This establishes an \"is-a\" relationship, where a child class is a specialized version of the parent class.\n",
        "    Method Overriding:\n",
        "    A child class can redefine a method inherited from its parent class. This allows the child class to provide a specific implementation of the method that suits its unique needs.\n",
        "    How Polymorphism Works:\n",
        "    When a method is called on an object, Python determines the correct method to execute at runtime based on the object's actual type.\n",
        "    If a child class has overridden a method from its parent, the child's version of the method is executed.\n",
        "    If a child class has not overridden a method, it uses the parent's implementation\n",
        "    eg:\n",
        "          class Animal:\n",
        "          def speak(self):\n",

        "    - Method chaining in Python is a programming technique that allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single line of code. Each method in the chain returns the object itself, allowing the next method to be called on the result. This approach enhances code readability and reduces the need for intermediate variables.\n",
        "    To implement method chaining, ensure that each method in your class returns self. This allows you to call another method directly on the result of the previous one.\n",
        "    eg:\n",
        "          class Calculator:\n",
        "          def __init__(self, value=0):\n",

        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - The __call__ method in Python allows instances of a class to be called as if they were functions. When an instance of a class is called using parentheses (), Python automatically invokes the __call__ method defined within that class. This enables objects to behave like functions, making the code more flexible and readable.\n",
